    "Because we're dealing with discrete distributions, we have to be careful about how we compare things. Options include comparing one part of the distribution, like the fraction of the class getting As, thinking about them as Bernoulli distributions. This has the benefit of having a clear 'effect size' that we can compare - given the size of some of these samples (that is, the overall number of grades), relatively minor differences between distributions will look statistically 'significant'. It will be good to have a way to quantify a bit how big the difference is in a practical way.\n",

Henry suggested using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test, which I had not used before, but looking into, it's clearly the appropriate sort of test to use in this situation. Thanks Henry!\n",

    "Here's a similar set of functions that do class to class comparisons by way of the Mann-Whitney U test. This looks at the overall distribution, rather than just the ratio of As. This creates a different sort of barrier to classify distributions as different - two classes may give out similar fractions of As, but different fractions of Bs and Cs, Mann-Whitney might decide that the difference is significant. Similarly, classes with very different fractions of As may be sufficiently similar elsewhere to not look statistically distinct to Mann-Whitney. Unfortunately, there isn't as straight forward a way to call out \"effect size\". Any measure of distance between the distributions will be less interpretable than something like the difference in ratio of A grades.\n",

    "But then it occurs to you that these overall comparisons are looking at a lot of higher level courses - advanced courses that only science majors take. Maybe the overall ratio of As in the physics department is being pulled up by the physics majors getting good grades in the advanced classes. You really want to know what the grading is like in the intro level courses.\n",
